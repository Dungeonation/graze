[Changes]
* Put the project up on GitHub! :D
* Turned the beginning of the code for carrying over Scratch code into comments 'cuz it's a bit not-work-y right now.
[Future Plans]
* The beginnings of Scratch code support of course
* De-YandereDev-ing my code and sorting it into functions so the code bullies don't laugh at me
